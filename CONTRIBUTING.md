Development Workflow

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2 . Build

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### 3. Run Playground

We recommend testing components in a local Vite/Next.js playground.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

âœ… Code Standards

TypeScript first: ensure proper typings.

Tailwind + ShadCN: use ShadCN style imports (e.g. @/components/ui/button).

Keep it modular: each new feature in src/packages/feature-name.
